# NLP_ChatBots

This repo is created to explore NLP concepts and techniques. In the process, I hope to build a chatbot that can answer simple queries given specific knowledge databases (SQL as well as noSQL).

Much of the foundation will be based on the following github repos:

[Edbullen's NLP Chatbot](https://github.com/edbullen/NLPBot)

[Gunther Cox's Chatterbot Framework](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot)

[Stanford's lecture on Chatbots through CS124](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/chatbot.pdf)


Thanks to them, the base chat engine is there. However, I hope to add further functionality such as:

1. Answer simple statistical questions given a relational table or graph.
2. Plot simple charts for trends and display them through D3 in Django.
3. Make a few inferences if possible (maybe linear regressions. this depends on the need. might not pursue)
4. Add voice control.
5. Add Avatar and simple feature expressions.
6. Add Emotions?
7. Hook to key apis to get daily data and news?
8. Hook to dairy apps or calendar to make simple notes.
